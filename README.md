# Tmall-Taobao-Extractor  

Tmall is the largest B2C platform in China with over 500 million registered customers
Tmall has over 50% market share of China’s B2C e-commerce business
Success of brands on Tmall is driven by strong a brand integrity and a “Flagship Store” approach


Tmall is an offshoot of another successful Alibaba e-commerce platform – Taobao. The key difference between Tmall and Taobao is that while Tmall is a B2C platform, Taobao is C2C (think of it like the difference between Amazon and Ebay). Tmall was set up largely because consumers felt more comfortable buying goods from a company directly rather than from an individual. Also, it was found the vast majority of the revenue from C2C sites (96% in 2012) was from the sales of new items – not second-hand. Thus a key driver for Tmall’s success is brand integrity. Only the brand owner or authorized dealer may operate a Tmall store. Tmall allows brands to manage their own sales, product offerings, and branding in Chinese e-commerce.
